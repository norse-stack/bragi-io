//! Markdown preprocessor (`preprocessors::md`).
//!
//! This module is the ingestion-side counterpart to the bgraph.md
//! emitter at `crate::graphs::serialization::markdown`. Together they
//! close the round-trip loop for the bgraph.md wire format
//! (the bgraph.md format spec (architecture doc 08)):
//!
//! ```text
//!     DocumentGraph ──emit_markdown──▶ bgraph.md string
//!           ▲                                │
//!           └────── parse_markdown ──────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why this does not implement the `Preprocessor` trait
//!
//! The bgraph.md path is *special*: a bgraph.md string is already a
//! fully-formed graph projection — it carries deterministic IDs,
//! provenance, bookmarks, and metadata in its document-level block.
//! Parsing it goes directly to a `DocumentGraph`, skipping the
//! `PreprocessorOutput` shape that the `Preprocessor` trait produces.
//!
//! Future generic-markdown ingestion (no bgraph metadata, just prose
//! with `#` headings) would implement the trait the same way
//! `preprocessors::pdf` does — but that work is deferred. v1 scope is
//! the round-trip artifact only. See
//! `ParseError::GenericMarkdownNotYetSupported`.

/// serializations: the bgraph.md doc-level `schema` field *and* the
/// json wrapper's `SortedDocumentGraph.schema_version` (CR-87). The

/// version. Re-exported at crate root as [`crate::BGRAPH_FORMAT_VERSION`]
/// so json-side and downstream consumers reach it without importing

///
/// This is the **schema/format axis** of the version model (arch-15):

/// from the **code axis** ([`crate::VERSION`], byte-stability /
/// attribution) and the **preprocessor axis**
/// ([`crate::cache::versions::PREPROCESSOR_INTERFACE_VERSION`], debug).
///
/// Follows X.Y.Z semantics = the *scale of node-ID churn* a consumer
/// should expect (MAJOR: derivation rule changed, all IDs move; MINOR:
/// additive structure, some IDs move; PATCH: affected nodes only). It
/// is **not** the content discriminator — `bgraph_sha256` moves on any
/// content change; this version tells a consumer how much to
/// diff/migrate. See arch-15 § Version model.
///
/// CR-87 harmonized the json side onto this `5.x` lineage (json's
/// `schema_version` went `0.9.0 → 5.0.0`, adopting the honest,
/// consumer-visible history); the retired `SCHEMA_VERSION = 0.9.0`
/// const was a mislabel. `bgraph_sha256` is unchanged — this const is a
/// wrapper/envelope field, outside the hash.
///
/// Downstream consumers pinning to the format axis (URD's compile-time
/// adapter assert, future tooling) target this constant.
///
/// The parser at [`bgraph_md::parse`] accepts every previous major's
/// shape as well, per the dual-support contract (spec § Amendment H).
///
/// v2.4.0 (CR-78): additive — the per-element fence gains an optional
/// `confidence: u8` field on Section nodes (detection-confidence
/// annotation; omitted when `0`). No consumer reads it yet (Phase A).
///
/// v2.5.0 (CR-81 + CR-82): coordinated bump. CR-82 adds the doc-level
/// `kind` discriminator (default `document`). CR-81 renames the
/// navigational-outline fence `bgraph-bookmarks` → `bgraph-outline` and
/// the JSON field `bookmark_data` → `outline_data`, and adds DOCX
/// Table-of-Contents-SDT outline extraction. Pre-2.5.0 files still parse
/// (kind defaults, both fence names accepted on read).
///
/// v3.0.0 (CR-83): **major** — every node ID's derivation changes. Node
/// IDs move from positional-in-a-source-hash-namespace
/// (`UUIDv5(UUIDv5(NS, "{source}:{config}"), text_order)`) to
/// content+breadcrumb (`UUIDv5(NS, breadcrumb ‖ content ‖ occurrence)`).
/// The result is document-unique (faithful round-trip) and edit-stable (a
/// node keeps its ID unless its own content or heading-path changes).
/// `text_order` stays as a node field (ordering/emission) but is no longer
/// an ID input. The **read path / walk algorithm is unchanged** — the
/// structural rule (split at the `` ```bgraph-<tag> `` line) is identical;
/// only the *values* of the embedded `id` fields change. Files emitted
/// under 1.x/2.x still parse structurally; their embedded IDs simply
/// differ from what a fresh 3.0.0 reparse derives. See
/// the bgraph.md format spec (architecture doc 08) § Amendment L.
///
/// v4.0.0 (Block A / Amendment M): **major** — the inaugural
/// **content-only edition: identity became the content body.**
/// `bgraph_sha256` is redefined from "canonical json incl. provenance"
/// to the hash of the content body alone: `parse_provenance` and
/// `structural_profile` leave the hash (envelope / json-wrapper
/// concerns), the CR-78 `confidence` placeholder leaves the wire
/// entirely, `flow_type` relocates onto `DocumentInfo`, and
/// `token_count` stays (deterministic `words/4`, a function of the
/// text alone — DT-01). Node IDs are **unchanged** (the Amendment L
/// key never referenced the evicted fields); only the doc-level
/// `bgraph_sha256` re-baselines. The walk algorithm is byte-identical
/// to v2/v3, so 2.x/3.x files still parse structurally — but their
/// stamped hashes were computed under the old definition and will not
/// verify under the v4 recompute (regenerate, or the library's
/// `ParseOptions.accept_drift` — the CLI's `--accept-drift` flag was
/// removed in Block C.3).
/// See the bgraph.md format spec (architecture doc 08) § Amendment M.
///
/// v5.0.0 (CR-84): **major** — **node identity is finalized after
/// topology settles.** The forward deterministic path re-keys every
/// node ID from the post-`graph_sanity` topology (the shared
/// derivation walk in `graphs::builder`), so the emitted IDs equal
/// what the reverse parser re-derives from the emitted tree — the
/// round-trip contract CR-83 promised but sanity-mutated (PDF)
/// documents violated. The same pass finalizes `location.semantic.path`
/// (the other build-time structural derivation sanity mutated out from
/// under — hashed content, so it must be derivable too). **Node-canon
/// impact:** IDs move *only* for documents where `graph_sanity` mutated
/// topology (PDF rebalance / demotions); MD, DOCX, and clean PDFs emit
/// byte-identical IDs v4→v5 (the re-key is idempotent on settled
/// topology). Also: per-element
/// `internal_refs` / `external_refs` are now retained on reverse parse
/// (they were parse-and-dropped; always in the forward hash — a
/// faithfulness fix riding this bump). The walk algorithm is
/// byte-identical to v2/v3/v4, so older files still parse
/// structurally; sanity-mutated v4 PDFs' stamped IDs/hashes will not
/// verify under v5 (that is the honest answer — regenerate, or the
/// library's `ParseOptions.accept_drift`).
///
/// **1.0.0 (Block C — the honest reset).** The `1.x → 5.x` lineage above
/// is **internal pre-museum churn with no external consumer** (the "no
/// fictional users" principle). Block C renumbers the format to its true
/// inaugural edition — `1.0.0`, "edition one of the content-body-identity
/// substrate" — declared once in the no-users window; arch-15's increment
/// semantics apply normally from `1.0.0` forward. The read path now
/// accepts **only `1.x`** (via the codec seam
/// [`crate::graphs::serialization::version::FormatVersion`]); every other
/// schema — including the retired `2.x`–`5.x` — is a clean
/// `UnsupportedSchema`, not something to best-effort-read. Emit is
/// byte-identical to the pre-reset `5.0.0` output except this version
/// string and the json envelope's new `bgraph_sha256` field; the
/// `bgraph_sha256` *value* is unchanged (the reset is a renumber, not a
/// canonical-form change).
///
/// **1.1.0 (OCR S1).** Additive minor bump: the `Equation` node variant
/// (fence tag `bgraph-equation`) joins the schema — display-math blocks
/// produced by the OCR channel, non-inline body like CodeBlock. The read
/// path already accepts all `1.x`, so `1.0.0` artifacts remain readable
/// unchanged; only newly-emitted artifacts stamp `1.1.0`.
///
/// **1.2.0 (CR-100 — image nodes).** Additive minor bump: the `Image`
/// node variant (fence tag `bgraph-image`) joins the schema — pictures
/// the OCR channel used to skip. Its body is the supplier's readable
/// markdown ref (`![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)`), **required by contract**
/// like a Section's heading line; the bytes ride in the fence as the
/// `image` payload (`{id, annotation, base64}`), never in body prose.
/// `token_count` is `0` by definition — token counts measure readable
/// text. The dead `NodeType::Figure` variant is **removed** in the same
/// bump: it existed from the beginning and was emitted by zero channels,
/// so nothing can fail to deserialize. **Re-baselines:** the emitted
/// `schema` string moves for every channel; `bgraph_sha256` moves only
/// for documents that actually carry images (the `image` field is
/// omitted from the wire when absent), so the standard PDF/Tika channel
/// and every imageless document hash exactly as before.
